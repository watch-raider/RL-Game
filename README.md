# Human Feedback-Based Reinforcement Learning in Cooperative Environments

## Project Overview

This repository contains two distinct projects exploring how AI agents can learn to cooperate with either humans or other AI agents:

### Single Agent Project
- The environment is a grid-based game where the human player (red square) must find a goal
- The AI agent (blue square) can move around and toggle directional lights to guide the human
- The agent receives rewards when the human moves closer to the goal and penalties when the human moves away
- The agent learns over time to provide better guidance through reinforcement learning

### Multi-Agent Project
- A cooperative environment where two AI agents work together to achieve a common goal
- Uses PettingZoo for multi-agent reinforcement learning
- Both agents can learn from each other's behavior and improve their cooperative strategies
- Agents receive rewards based on their collective performance in reaching the goal

- Training and evaluation modes
- Performance tracking and visualization
- Customizable environment settings

### Multi-Agent Project
- PettingZoo-based multi-agent environment
- Cooperative learning between AI agents
- Shared reward system
- Training and evaluation modes
- Performance tracking and visualization

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package installer)

### Installation

1. Clone this repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/watch-raider/RL-Game.git
   cd RL-Game
   ```

2. Create virtual environments for each project:
   ```
   # For Single Agent Project
   cd Single
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt

   # For Multi-Agent Project
   cd ../Multi
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Running the Applications

#### Single Agent Project
1. Navigate to the Single directory:
   ```
   cd Single
   ```

2. Run the main application:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

3. Use the menu to:
   - Select screen size
   - Choose a learning model (PPO, TRPO, or A2C)
   - Select mode (Training or Evaluation)
   - Start the game

#### Multi-Agent Project
1. Navigate to the Multi directory:
   ```
   cd Multi
   ```

2. Run the main application:
   ```
   python main.py
   ```

3. Use the menu to:
   - Select screen size
   - Choose a learning model
   - Select mode (Training or Evaluation)
   - Start the simulation

### How to Play

#### Single Agent Project
- **As a human player**: Use the arrow keys to move the red square
- **Watch the AI agent**: The blue square will move and toggle lights to guide you
- **Goal**: Follow the agent's guidance to find the hidden goal

#### Multi-Agent Project
- **Watch the AI agents**: Two AI agents will work together to achieve the goal
- **Goal**: Observe how the agents learn to cooperate and improve their strategies
